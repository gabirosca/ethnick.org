        <p>ETHNICK has developed multiple programs to exemplify the mission of the organization. ETHNICK will begin
          offering programs in 2012. ETHNICK is devoted to perfecting and expanding these programs to a larger audience.
          By requesting constant feedback from our students, parents and organizations involved in this project, ETHNICK
          will adapt all of its programs in order to best serve our participants.</p>

      <div class="title col-12">
        <h1>Global Exposure Program</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="col-6">
        <p>
          ETHNICK’s core mission is to increase mutual understanding and sustainable development by using alternative
          education models, raising awareness and generating direct exposure opportunities for our youth and young
          professionals.</p>


        <p>
          We look to bring our contribution in the achievement of these goals by developing and offering educational and
          cultural exchange programs, including the exchange of scholars, researchers, professionals, students and
          educators.</p>
        <p>
          ETHNICK seeks to establish unique international exposure opportunities and partnerships to benefit a
          population that is not being addressed through existing authorized exchanges.</p>
        <p>
          The desired result of this program is to develop cultural awareness, improve students’ knowledge base through
          coursework, as well as direct exposure opportunities and to create a communication platform for students and
          partner organizations to use in the sharing of valuable information, support and networking.</p>
        <p>
          Students will be tasked with keeping a journal during the trip. The journal will serve two purposes: it will
          allow students to keep a detailed record of the trip and the information documented in the journal will be the
          basis for writing a publishable article about their experience. During the trip, students will be given an
          aspect of culture, government and/or history to take note of.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-6">

        <p>
          They will include this component in their article and be asked to analyze the similarities and differences of
          said component between the two countries. By doing so we provide the student with a basic structure for
          his/her final article, stimulate them to learn and formulate personally informed opinions and decisions, and
          provide them with common subjects while encouraging a constructive debate in a controlled, dedicated
          environment.</p>
        <p>
          As preparation for the trip, interested students and parents will attend an information session at the Embassy
          of Bahrain. Participants will have the opportunity to meet and speak with the Bahraini Ambassador to the
          United States and members of ETHNICK’s team. ETHNICK’s staff will provide students with an information package
          regarding the details of the trip.</p>
        <p>
          The group of students and chaperones will travel to Manama from June 15 to June 25, 2019. Accompanied by two
          chaperones and met by two ETHNICK board members upon arrival in Bahrain, the ten to twenty students will spend
          the week learning about the history, culture and government of Bahrain guided by the staff of our partner host
          organization, the Ministry of Youth and Sports (MOYS). Students will have the opportunity to visit local
          museums and attractions as well as some of the main institutions of the Bahraini state.</p>
        <p>
          Upon completion of the program students will have learned more about the ever-evolving world they live in
          while also developing a network of like-minded individuals ready to tackle whatever problems they are
          confronted with in a more determined and confident manner.
